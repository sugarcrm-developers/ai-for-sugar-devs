# CLAUDE.md — Project Guide for Claude Code

This repository is a **Sugar developer skills library** for generating installable, upgrade-safe SugarCRM Module Loadable Packages (MLPs). It supports anything from a single logic-hook MLP up to a full multi-module package with relationships, sidecar layouts, icons, and language registration.

## Available skills

All skills live under [`skills/`](skills/) — the canonical, tool-agnostic source. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `when_to_use`, `not_for`, `related_skills`) plus a body containing examples, rules, gotchas, and cross-references.

[`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) is a **copy** of the same files, kept only so Claude Code's own skill auto-discovery (which scans `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, not a repo-root `skills/`) picks them up automatically. `skills/` stays the single source of truth for humans and every other agent — when you edit a skill, copy the change into both locations, or run:

```bash
cp -R skills/. .claude/skills/
```

Claude Code can:
- Invoke a skill via the Skill tool when frontmatter matches developer intent
- Or read `skills/sugar-<topic>/SKILL.md` directly for the spec

## Entry points for AI agents

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — the binding execution contract (mandatory specifications, prohibited actions, code quality standards). Read this before generating any package.
- **[skills/sugar-feature-generator/SKILL.md](skills/sugar-feature-generator/SKILL.md)** — orchestrator skill that routes a structured feature request to the right topic skill.
- **[prompts/feature_request_format.md](prompts/feature_request_format.md)** — canonical input schema for feature requests.

## Reference material

- **[reference/master_reference.md](reference/master_reference.md)** — complete Sugar Extension Framework specifications.
- **[reference/installdefs_cheatsheet.md](reference/installdefs_cheatsheet.md)** — one-page table of the 7 installdefs sections (added in Tier 3).
- **[reference/module_anatomy.md](reference/module_anatomy.md)** — file-by-file walkthrough of a complete MB-style module (added in Tier 3).
- **[reference/common_gotchas.md](reference/common_gotchas.md)** — symptom → root-cause table (added in Tier 3).
- **[reference/sugar_developer_guide_25.2_md/](reference/sugar_developer_guide_25.2_md/)** — official Sugar Developer Guide (read-only mirror).

## Templates

- **[templates/minimal_mlp/pack.stub.php](templates/minimal_mlp/pack.stub.php)** — reference pack.php (enhanced in Tier 3 with 7-section glob scanner).
- **[templates/full_module/](templates/full_module/)** — parameterized full-module skeleton (added in Tier 3).
- **[templates/relationship/](templates/relationship/)** — 5-file relationship template (added in Tier 3).

## Examples

See [`examples/`](examples/) for copy/paste feature requests and walkthroughs:
- single-feature MLPs (logic hook, custom field, relationship, REST endpoint)
- multi-module packages (added in Tier 4)
- Notes 1:M attachments (added in Tier 4)

## Conventions enforced everywhere

These appear in every skill where relevant — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) "Recent Mandates (v2)" for the complete list:

1. Custom field names MUST end in `_c`
2. Vardefs use `vname`, never `label`
3. No `'help'` text on vardefs — labels carry it
4. `image_dir` belongs in `installdefs`, never in `$manifest`
5. Singular/plural Escalation pattern (module folder/table plural; bean class/object_name/dictionary key singular)
6. Relationships: lhs = parent (the linked-to), rhs = child (has the link)
7. HTTP requests use `Sugarcrm\Sugarcrm\Security\HttpClient\ExternalResourceClient` only — never curl/file_get_contents/fopen/stream_get_contents
8. `$app_list_strings` for module list and dropdowns belong in application-scope language files
9. After install: new fields on OOB modules need Studio drag-place on the record view
